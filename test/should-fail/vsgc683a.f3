/*
 * Regression test: VSGC-683: Use F3 type name rather than Java type names in error messages
 *
 * @test/compile-error
 *
 * This should produce:
 *
 *     vsgc683a.f3:38: incompatible types
 *     found   : vsgc683a.Node[]
 *     required: vsgc683a.Node
 *         content: [Node {}]
 *                  ^
 *     1 error
 * 
 * instead of
 * 
 *     vsgc683a.f3:38: incompatible types
 *     found   : org.f3.runtime.sequence.Sequence<? extends vsgc683a.Node>
 *     required: vsgc683a.Node
 *         content: [Node {}]
 *                  ^
 *     1 error
 * 
 * There doesn't seem to be a way to provide .EXPECTED files 
 * for tests that are expected to fail compilation.
